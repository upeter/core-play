Core Play
=========

This is the Play 2 project accompanying my presentation called "Core Play". It contains all the sample code in the slides, and serves as a starting point for the 'Hands On' session.

Getting started
---------------

To run the sample do the following:

# git clone git@github.com:upeter/core-play.git
# cd to core-play directory
# run: sbt
# in play-shell run: run
# Open a browser and add url: http://localhost:9000/websockets
# In the websocket address field enter: ws://localhost:9000/websockets/cpu-info
# Hit the 'connect' button and repeat the connect in other tabs. Look what happens...
